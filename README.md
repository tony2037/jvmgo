# Java virtual machine implementation based on golang

## Search class
```
To activate a JAVA program, Before calling **main()**, the jvm has to load the relative classes, e.g **java.lang.Object**.

As the resulte, a jvm has to be able to search classes. The question is: where should jvm go to search?

The standard (see [java loader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Classloader), also [classpath, java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classpath_(Java))) does not specify where should JVM go to search class. Different JVMs are allowed to search based on different implementation.

Here, classpath can be seperate into the 3 parts:
* bootstrap classpath
	* default: `jre/lib`, Java standard library (most in `rt.jar`) is here.
* extension classpath
	* `jre/lib/ext`, the classes using Java extension mechanism (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/index.html) are here
* user classpath
	* The third-party classes
	* `CLASSPATH` enviroment variable
	* `-classpath/-cp` option, e.g `java -cp path/to/classes;lib/a.jar;lib/b.jar`
```
* `classpath/` is used to implement:
	* Entry interface
	* DirEntry: absolute path, read `.class`
	* ZipEntry: read `ZIP` or `JAR`, which the classes being extracted from
	* CompositeEntry: traverse all
	* WildcardEntry: `*`, all classes, but do not dig into child directories

```
A class file consists of a stream of 8-bit bytes. All 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit quantities are constructed by reading in two, four, and eight consecutive 8-bit bytes, respectively. Multibyte data items are always stored in big-endian order, where the high bytes come first. In the Java SE platform, this format is supported by interfaces java.io.DataInput and java.io.DataOutput and classes such as java.io.DataInputStream and java.io.DataOutputStream.

This chapter defines its own set of data types representing class file data: The types **u1, u2, and u4 represent an unsigned one-, two-, or four-byte quantity**, respectively. In the Java SE platform, these types may be read by methods such as readUnsignedByte, readUnsignedShort, and readInt of the interface java.io.DataInput.

    u4             magic;
    u2             minor_version;
    u2             major_version;
    u2             constant_pool_count;
    cp_info        constant_pool[constant_pool_count-1];
    u2             access_flags;
    u2             this_class;
    u2             super_class;
    u2             interfaces_count;
    u2             interfaces[interfaces_count];
    u2             fields_count;
    field_info     fields[fields_count];
    u2             methods_count;
    method_info    methods[methods_count];
    u2             attributes_count;
    attribute_info attributes[attributes_count];

## Run-Time Data Areas
- [ ] see: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.5
```
The Java Virtual Machine defines various run-time data areas that are used during execution of a program. Some of these data areas are created on Java Virtual Machine start-up and are destroyed only when the Java Virtual Machine exits. Other data areas are per thread. Per-thread data areas are created when a thread is created and destroyed when the thread exits.
```
### There are two type of Run-Time Data Areas:
* Multi-threads shared:
	* [create]: JVM starts up
	* [destory]: JVM exits

* Per-thread data areas:
	* [create]: thread is created
	* [destory]: thread exits

### There would be ...
* The pc Register: Each Java Virtual Machine thread has its own pc pointing to the current method
* Java Virtual Machine Stacks: Each Java Virtual Machine thread has a private Java Virtual Machine stack, A Java Virtual Machine stack stores frames (ยง2.6) Does not need to be contiguous.
	* StackOverflowError
	* OutOfMemoryError
* Heap: The Java Virtual Machine has a heap that is shared among all Java Virtual Machine threads.
	* OutOfMemoryError
* Method Area: The Java Virtual Machine has a method area that is shared among all Java Virtual Machine threads. It's analogous to the "text" segment in an operating system process. 
* Run-Time Constant Pool: A run-time constant pool is a per-class or per-interface run-time representation of the constant_pool table in a class file (ยง4.4)
* Native Method Stacks: An implementation of the Java Virtual Machine may use conventional stacks, colloquially called "C stacks," to support native methods (methods written in a language other than the Java programming language). Native method stacks may also be used by the implementation of an interpreter for the Java Virtual Machine's instruction set in a language such as C. Java Virtual Machine implementations that cannot load native methods and that do not themselves rely on conventional stacks need not supply native method stacks. If supplied, native method stacks are typically allocated per thread when each thread is created.

## Frames
* Local Variables
	* A single local variable can hold a value of type boolean, byte, char, short, int, float, reference, or returnAddress.
	* A pair of local variables can hold a value of type long or double.
* Operand Stacks
* Dynamic Linking
* Normal Method Invocation Completion
* Abrupt Method Invocation Completion
